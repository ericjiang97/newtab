# newtab

New tab is a Nifty Extension where it:
* displays current temperature (currently limited to Melbourne and Sydney) and forecast
* quick shortcuts inspired by [@nchlswhttkr's new-tab](https://github.com/nchlswhttkr/new-tab)
    * if no shortcut is detected, and user hits enter, it will automatically query Google
* Shows your 4 most recent page visits

This has been confirmed working in both Chrome and Firefox
